# 💻 PHP MySQL User Status Manager

This is a simple web-based project that allows users to enter their name and age, and stores the data in a MySQL database. Each user also has a toggleable **status** (active/inactive) that can be updated directly from the user table.

## 🎯 Project Goal  
Learn how to:
- Use HTML forms to accept user input  
- Store data in a MySQL database using PHP  
- Display users in a table format  
- Update user status with a toggle button  
- Handle basic database operations (Insert, Update, Fetch)

## 🧱 What We Did

We created a dynamic website using PHP, which connects to a MySQL database.  
Users can:
- Submit their name and age  
- View the list of registered users  
- Toggle the status of each user (Active / Inactive)

We designed the database using **phpMyAdmin** and exported the structure to `users_db.sql`.  
We used **XAMPP** as a local server to run the project.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User submits name and age using the form  
2. PHP stores the data into the `users` table  
3. The table below the form shows all users  
4. The **Status** column can be toggled by clicking a button  
5. Status is stored in the database as `0` (Inactive) or `1` (Active)

---

## 🗃️ Database Schema (users_db.sql)

```sql
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `ID` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Name` varchar(100),
  `Age` int,
  `Status` tinyint DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ID`)
);
```
